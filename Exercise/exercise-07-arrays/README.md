# Exercise 07: Arrays

## Objective
Work with typed arrays and array methods.

## Instructions
1. Create array of numbers
2. Create array of strings
3. Find sum of all numbers
4. Find largest number
5. Filter even numbers
6. Map numbers to their squares
7. Join string array into sentence

## Expected Output
```
Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Sum: 55
Largest: 10
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
Sentence: Hello world from TypeScript
```

## Hints
- Use `.reduce()` for sum
- Use `Math.max(...array)` for largest
- Use `.filter()` for filtering
- Use `.map()` for transformation
- Use `.join()` for combining strings
