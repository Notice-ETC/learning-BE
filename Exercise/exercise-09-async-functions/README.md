# Exercise 09: Async Functions

## Objective
Learn to work with asynchronous functions and Promises.

## Instructions
1. Create async function that simulates fetching user data
2. Create async function that simulates saving data
3. Use async/await to call these functions
4. Handle errors with try-catch

## Expected Output
```
Fetching user data...
User data: { id: '1', name: 'John Doe' }
Saving user...
User saved successfully!
```

## Hints
- Use `async` keyword before function
- Use `await` to wait for Promise
- Return `Promise<Type>` as return type
- Use `setTimeout` with Promise for simulation
