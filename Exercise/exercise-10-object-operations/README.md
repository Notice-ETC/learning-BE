# Exercise 10: Object Operations

## Objective
Work with objects, destructuring, and object methods.

## Instructions
1. Create interface for Student (id, name, scores array)
2. Create student object
3. Calculate average score
4. Add new score to student
5. Use object destructuring
6. Create copy of object with spread operator

## Expected Output
```
Student: John Doe
Scores: [85, 90, 88]
Average: 87.67
After adding new score: [85, 90, 88, 95]
New average: 89.50
```

## Hints
- Use object destructuring: `const { property } = object`
- Use spread operator: `{ ...object }`
- Calculate average: sum / count
